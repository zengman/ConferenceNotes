### 101. A General Model for DoF-based Interference Cancellation in MIMO Networks With Rank-Deficient Channels
1. DoF(degree-of-freedom) based model studing MIMO wireless network,
2. not close to ideal, developing a general theory for DoF-based model under rank-deficient conditions. 
3. DoF scheduling in a multi-link MIMO network
